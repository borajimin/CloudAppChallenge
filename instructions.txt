# Platform Engineering Coding Assignment

Thank you for your interest in the position with CloudApp! For us to be able to assess your skills, we kindly ask you to provide a solution to the assignment below. You should not spend more than a day on it.

## Assignment:

In order to help showcase your full-stack talents, weâ€™re asking you a create and deploy a small service that allows a user to collect images and gifs from a web URL, and view them on a web page.

We encourage the use of

* Google Cloud Platform's free tier or similar for deploying your work
  -Amazon EC2
* Your choice of preferred languages, tools, frameworks, libraries and services
  -JavaScript, Node, etc.
* Microservices Architecture

To help organize the prompt we'll evaluate the project in 3 parts:

#### Part 1:

Write an endpoint that takes a valid public Url as input and outputs a JSON payload with at least the following information:

* The webpage that was scraped
* A list of assets on the webpage with the name of the file and the source url

Bonus points for additional file types or meta data of your choosing.

#### Part 2:

Create a simple webpage that presents the user with a input field for collecting a Url, and uses the service from Part 1 to display the collected assets to the user.

Again, feel free to use whatever tools, or frameworks you see fit, and take whatever creative liberties with the prompt you'd like.

#### Part 3:

Deploy your services from Parts 1 & 2 to GCP's Free Tier (or equivalent) to submit your assignment. When you finish, provide access to a GCP project you have created to `jason@cl.ly` and `stan@cl.ly`.
